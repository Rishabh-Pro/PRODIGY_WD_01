        <h2>Protect Rainforests</h2>
        <p>Historic approaches to rainforest conservation have failed, as demonstrated by the accelerated rate of deforestation. In many regions, closing off forests as untouchable parks and reserves has neither improved the quality of living or economic opportunities for rural poor nor deterred forest clearing by illegal loggers and developers. Corruption has only worsened the situation.</p>
        <p>The problem with this traditional park approach to preserving wildlands in developing countries is that it fails to generate sufficient economic incentives for respecting and maintaining the forest. Rainforests will only continue to survive as functional ecosystems if they can be shown to provide tangible economic benefits.</p>
        <h2>Protect Nature</h2>
        <p>At its core, conservation is the careful management and preservation of natural resources and the environment. It's a proactive approach to ensure that the wonders of our natural world - from vast forests to the tiniest insects - are safeguarded for future generations.</p>
        <p>Conservation is the act of preserving, guarding, or protecting - in the context of the environment, it means the sustainable use and management of natural resources, including wildlife, water, air, and earth deposits.</p>
